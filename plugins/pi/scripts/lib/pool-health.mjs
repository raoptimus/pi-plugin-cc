/**
 * Pool liveness, as the plugin itself sees it.
 *
 * A pool with free slots is not a pool that works: a run dispatched to an
 * account with an exhausted balance dies in seconds (402 Insufficient Balance),
 * and the next run walks straight into the same wall, because nothing on the
 * dispatch path remembers the death. The journal and the job records already
 * hold every outcome, but they are history, not state the choice can read
 * before spending a container and minutes on a pool that cannot answer.
 *
 * This module keeps that state: one machine-wide JSON file next to the plugin's
 * other records (same reasoning as `fleet-events.jsonl` — pools belong to the
 * machine's config, not to one workspace bucket, so a run started from a
 * subdirectory must see the same liveness as one started from the root).
 *
 * Only provider-side death is recorded here, in three classes: balance (the
 * account cannot pay — returns whenever money does), quota (a windowed limit —
 * returns when the window rolls over), network (the endpoint is unreachable —
 * usually brief). A failure that belongs to the task or the brief (`400`, an
 * unknown model, a parse error) must NOT touch this state: one mistyped
 * command would otherwise evict a perfectly live pool.
 *
 * Both eviction and return are automatic (owner's decision D-12): a dead pool
 * stops being offered until its probe deadline, then re-enters the choice in
 * its normal order; a successful run on it erases the record entirely. No
 * manual "revive" step exists in the normal loop — the `pools` command is
 * debugging, not part of the circuit.
