# Installing this checkout as a plugin, without going through GitHub.
#
# The published route is the marketplace in the README: push, then let every
# machine pull the release. This file is the other one — the working copy itself
# registered as a directory marketplace, so an edit reaches the installed plugin
# with one `make update` instead of a push and a refresh.
#
# `make install` binds the installation to the current path of this directory:
# moving the checkout means running it again.
#
# The marketplace name here is the same `pi-tools` the GitHub one uses (it comes
# from .claude-plugin/marketplace.json, which both share). If this machine still
# has the GitHub marketplace registered, drop it first — `make uninstall`, or
# `claude plugin marketplace remove pi-tools` — or the name collides.

# Why not `claude plugin update`: with a bare name it does not resolve the
# plugin at all, and with `plugin@marketplace` it compares the `version` field
# and copies nothing when the two are equal. Version is frozen at 0.1.0 here, so
# that path reports success and leaves the installed copy on the old code.
# `install` always copies the directory whole, which is why an update is a
# reinstall. (The other fix is to bump `version` in both manifests — that is the
# only one a user installing from GitHub has.)
#
# Uninstall refuses while another Claude Code session holds the installed copy.
# Close the other sessions — this one included — if it does.

# The name `pi-tools` is shared with the GitHub marketplace this repo publishes
# to, and `marketplace add` does not displace a registration that already holds
# the name. Leave the GitHub one registered and every `make update` refreshes a
# git clone instead of this directory: the reinstall runs, reports success, and
# installs origin/main. Nothing in the output says so — the only visible symptom
# is an edit that never takes effect. Hence a check before anything is touched,
# and a non-zero exit rather than a warning: a silent failure is what this cost.

# The pi half has nothing to install. `pia` is a symlink into this checkout
# (`make link`), so the CLI is already live; what the pi side actually runs from
# elsewhere is the sandbox image, and it is built from the Dockerfiles in the
# user's own pi directory — not from the one this repo ships. So this half
# checks rather than copies, and it checks the two things that go wrong quietly:
# the shim in PATH pointing at a different checkout, a live sandbox file that has
# drifted from the one this repo ships, and an image holding an older pi than the
# host. None of the three shows up in the CLI output; each means the agent runs
# something nobody chose. The shim is fatal — it makes the whole update a
# no-op for the CLI. The Dockerfile drift stays a warning: the live file is the
# owner's to diverge, and a rebuild is not part of an update anyway.
#
# A rebuild is minutes and gigabytes, so it is opt-in: PI_REBUILD=1 make update.
